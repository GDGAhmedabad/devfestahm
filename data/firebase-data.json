It also comes with predefined APIs using which mobile app developers can implement functionalities like image labeling, face detection, barcode scanning etc. in the apps. In this session we will cover basics of ML Kit first. This will show how mobile app developers can use the SDK in their  android project. After this we will explore all the base APIs of SDK with demos. We will have quick demo to demonstrate capabilities of the each APIs.
