As every year at DevFest Ahmedabad, we are seeking values- and experience-based Talk proposals that demonstrate the implementation of practices in your product(s) and the achievement of user growth, revenue growth, code scalability, funding generation, and the development of an MVP with solid principles and practices.

This year, we are not expecting talks on topics like Getting Started with Something or beginner level, which one can search over the web and find out quickly, like “Getting Started with Flutter development,” “How to implement MVVM in Android”, “Getting started with JavaScript technologies”, etc.

__And the most important thing, the topics MUST BE focused for this year's AI/ML integration or development theme.__

**DOs of CFP**

- Please elaborate on the topic properly to help you understand and review your talk.
- Please submit details about your past talk(s).
- Please include links to your past talk(s) presentations, videos, etc.
- Please mention the critical takeaways of your talks and how they will benefit the developers.

**DON'T of CFP**

- Pitching and marketing of the product or company. A speaker can mention the company name, but the focus of the talk should be technology.
- The talk should be the speaker's original idea and should not be copied from someone else.
- The topic should be relevant to the audience and should be in practice in recent years.
- Avoid talks like Getting Started or Hello World.
