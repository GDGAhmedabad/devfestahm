Such computations freeze our apps' one and only thread, frustrating our users with a sluggish UI. \n\nIn this talk, I will dive deep into how Web Workers can absolutely supercharge your apps with true multithreading capabilities. We'll see how Web Workers allow you to offload heavy tasks to background threads, freeing up your main thread to make your applications responsive and smooth. \n\nKey Takeaways from the Talk: \n- Understanding the single-threaded nature of Javascript web apps and performance implications, with real-world scenarios \n- Fundamentals of Web Workers and how can you integrate them seamlessly into your apps \n- Best Practices of using Web Workers and how to avoid common pitfalls \n\nDon't let the performance bottleneck hold you back from delivering smooth and seamless web apps!",
