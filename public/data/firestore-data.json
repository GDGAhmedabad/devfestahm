Currently an active Machine Learning explorer, I've used Python for all reasons and seasons over the last 4 years including Data Science to ACM ICPC Regional Finals for 2 consecutive years, where I fell prey to a precision loss in Python - and hence the will to master it. I'm an active speaker at Google Developers Group Kolkata talking often about machine learning and cloud computing, including the GDG DevFest Kolkata 2018. I'm also a speaker for the Elastic Search Kolkata Community and Neo4j Community. I am among the youngest instructors at DataCamp, which is a global platform for learning DataScience. I'm also currently authoring 2 books on Deep Learning using Python expected to be published in late 2019 by Packt Publications. I have been recognized as an Intel Software Innovator.",

The kind of solutions I can design could be for a desktop application, portables or any other medium that can benefit from the user experience I designed. I have deep understanding about the web architecture and consider my self a specialist in portable/mobile design solutions (for android). With an obsession to produce high performance apps that have a unique experience and still work without crashing or launching in most extreme hardware configurations. My association with creativity has been since childhood when I used to click photographs and even won numerous awards for various creative showcases overtime. That interest later developed into a more profound Degree in Visual Effects and Motion graphics from a top film college in United Kingdom. Even then I impressed my lecturers and peers with my creativity and skill-set and went on to win biggest student film and visual effects award of UK sponsored by Cinefex magazine/presented by Oscar Winner vfx supervisor Paul Franklin.",
