I have deep understanding about the web architecture and consider my self a specialist in portable/mobile design solutions (for android).

My association with creativity has been since childhood when I used to click photographs and even won numerous awards for various creative showcases overtime. That interest later developed into a more profound Degree in Visual Effects and Motion graphics from a top film college in United Kingdom.
