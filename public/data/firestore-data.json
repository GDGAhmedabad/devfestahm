The next evolution is sharing intelligence.\r\nThis session explores how AI agents can live inside shared Kotlin codebases - reasoning, planning, and acting across Android, iOS, and backend (ktor) targets.\r\n\r\nWe'll build a practical KMP app that integrates Koog, Gemini Nano, and Vertex AI, combining on-device inference with cloud-based reasoning to enable context-aware and adaptive behavior. You’ll learn how to design agent lifecycles, manage shared state and context across coroutines and Flows, and safely expose structured actions to platform layers.\r\n\r\nWe'll also cover production-ready concerns like concurrency control, observability, and debugging intelligent flows—giving you a hands-on blueprint for embedding intelligence directly into your shared Kotlin architecture.",

I will show real examples and learn practical tips for your projects.\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- How to design configurable, reusable widgets that scale across multiple teams and features.\r\n- Using golden tests, widget tests, and Widgetbook to keep your design system reliable and discoverable.\r\n- Best practices for docs, CI/CD, and developer experience so teams adopt the system seamlessly.",

This session shows how to ship offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Flutter: chunk domain docs, create on-device embeddings, and run local k-NN to answer FAQs in <200 ms on mid-tier Android. We’ll compare vector storage (Isar vs SQLite), pick embedding routes (precomputed vs on-device via llama.cpp/GGUF or Gemini Nano where available), and wire a tiny local answerer (extractive or compact LLM). Live demo: Wi-Fi off, instant answers to policy questions. \r\n\r\nPrivacy jeeti, latency jeeti—aur cloud bill bole: shukriya bhai.\r\n\r\nWhat attendees get\r\n\r\n- A reference offline RAG pipeline (chunking → embeddings → local k-NN).\r\n\r\n- Latency & size budgets to hit <200 ms P95 for ~5k chunks.\r\n\r\n- A vector store recipe (schema, L2 normalization, isolates, k-tuning).\r\n\r\n- A lightweight answering strategy (extractive vs tiny local LLM) with fallbacks.\r\n\r\n- A minimal eval harness for latency, recall@k, and accuracy in CI.",

The talk will include the tricky bits, like keeping track of state when things are changing, and how to build layouts in a way that's easier to manage.

I have deep understanding about the web architecture and consider my self a specialist in portable/mobile design solutions (for android).

My association with creativity has been since childhood when I used to click photographs and even won numerous awards for various creative showcases overtime. That interest later developed into a more profound Degree in Visual Effects and Motion graphics from a top film college in United Kingdom.
